# Circuit Python performance
This is mostly for HackSpace mag work so I don't lose benchmark results for the scripts that create them. The benchmarks here are from the MicroPython github project but rejigged to put them all in one big file. The parameters are set so they can run on a SAMD21.

I may at some point tidy up the code or add more benchmarks.

If you have other hardware, please do run it and send in a pull request with your results.
